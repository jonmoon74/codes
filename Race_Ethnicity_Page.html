        <p>
          Following the tragic and untimely death of a young black man in Minnesota I wanted to share some thoughts and words with you during what is certainly a pivotal time for us as a generation. <br /><br />
          Personally, I am more than aware that as a white person I have privileges and I am choosing to use those privileges to ensure that I actively stand with the opposed. I recognise I do not know your struggles first-hand, I do not understand, however I stand.  <br /><br />
          I am indeed proud to work for a company that holds diversity and inclusion at the heart of its core values, however I am aware there is still much to be done. <br /><br />
          Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time, we are the ones we’ve been waiting for and we are the change that we seek. We must take the time to continue to educate ourselves on how we can move forward together. Together as one.<br /><br />
          I will continuously contribute in any way I can to ensure that people of colour in our business and all around me feel the safety, inclusion and value that is deserved; you are valued, you are talent, you are no lesser than any other and should never be made to feel this way.<br /><br /><span class="credit">Rachel Jones, Director of Talent, Learning, Engagement, Wellbeing and Organisational Design UK & Ireland</span>

This training program explores the impact of biases and guides managers as they develop action plans for leading more inclusively. Conscious Inclusion equips managers to start courageous conversations that they might otherwise have avoided, which encourages all employees to be authentic and ensures that all the voices in the room are heard. They also focus on moments of choice, for example in hiring, to fight an unconscious bias to prefer someone just like you. Every participant in the training is encouraged to commit to inclusive actions that they can bring with them into the workplace.">Eli Lilly and Company—Employee Journeys and People Strategy</a></li>

Bank of America’s Board of Directors is included in the more than 60,000 participants who have engaged in courageous conversations, demonstrating the company’s commitment to being an inclusive workplace that welcomes dialogue on issues that are important to its employees and the communities they serve.">Bank of America—Investing in Women</a></li>
